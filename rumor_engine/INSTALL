THE EASY WAY

just type "make" in the root dir.


THE HARD WAY

1. go to folder "rumor" and compile the common objects:

cd rumor
make
cd ..

2. go to demo folders "demo1", "demo2" and "demo3" and compile the demos:

cd demo1
make
cd ..
cd demo2
make
cd ..
cd demo3
make
cd..


NOTE!

if you get errors when running "make" try the next exports before
reissuing "make":

export LD=gcc
export CC=gcc
