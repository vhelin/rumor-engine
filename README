Introduction:

Rumor Engine (RE) is a set of rules that can be used to create an
adaptive AI suitable for role playing games. With RE you can drop
your bots into a new world and watch them learn about the surroundings
and life there. You have to tag the enviroment and actions, but RE
spreads the word. In this game only those with information and respect
will survive.


Current features:

* Completely adaptive (world, bots, objects, all can change)
* Bots distribute information by telling rumors
* Rumors are generated by witnessing an action or seeing a specific place or object
* Bots create hierarchies by maintaining respect to each other (they know)
* Bots will learn about the place they inhabit, and even more from visitors
